SDK Usage
=========

The shared SDK lives in ``NexusBLESdk``. Most custom integrations start with ``open_gateway_serial`` and ``GatewayClient``, then layer a sensor-specific client or custom workflow on top.

Public source reference: `NexusBLESdk/ <https://github.com/Nexus-N3/rs-nexus-ble-tooling/tree/main/NexusBLESdk>`_.

Basic Connection Pattern
------------------------

.. code-block:: python

   from NexusBLESdk import GatewayClient, open_gateway_serial

   with open_gateway_serial() as ser:
       gateway = GatewayClient(ser, client_name="customer_example")
       gateway.reset_session()
       gateway.hello()
       devices = gateway.scan(timeout_ms=5000, name_filter="Movella DOT")
       connections = gateway.connect([devices[0].address], timeout_s=30.0)

Core SDK APIs
-------------

``open_gateway_serial``
   Opens the serial transport to the gateway using the validated default baud rate and serial settings.

``GatewayClient``
   Provides request helpers for discovery, connection management, GATT operations, status collection, and mixed JSON/binary stream parsing.

``StartupGateConfig``
   Defines the thresholds used before stream data is considered stable enough for official measurement.

``GenericStreamMonitor``
   Tracks stream health, startup-gate state, packet counts, and rate or gap metrics across one or more active sensors.

Typical GatewayClient Methods
-----------------------------

- ``hello()`` validates protocol compatibility.
- ``reset_session()`` clears previous gateway state before a new run.
- ``scan()`` discovers nearby devices, optionally filtered by sensor name.
- ``connect()`` requests explicit BLE connections by address.
- ``subscribe()`` or ``subscribe_with_retry()`` enables notifications for a characteristic.
- ``write_gatt()`` and ``write_gatt_nowait()`` send configuration or control writes.
- ``read_gatt()`` reads a characteristic value.
- ``disconnect()`` closes one or more active links.
- ``get_status_snapshot()`` collects transport and BLE receive diagnostics.

Monitoring Pattern
------------------

The stream clients use ``GenericStreamMonitor`` with a sensor-specific timestamp parser. This keeps transport handling generic while allowing each sensor package to define how packet timestamps are interpreted.

When startup gating is enabled, the monitor:

- waits for an observation window
- checks packet volume
- checks observed rate
- checks for gap events
- activates official measurement only after the stream is stable

Build Your Own Client
---------------------

Customers who need a custom host application can either:

- reuse ``GatewayClient`` directly and implement their own sensor workflow, or
- follow the repository pattern and create a new sensor package beside ``MovellaDot`` and ``NexusN3Dot``.
