RS Nexus BLE Tooling
====================

RS Nexus BLE Tooling is the customer-facing Python host toolkit for the RS Nexus BLE Gateway. It provides a shared gateway SDK, supported sensor clients, and runnable sample applications for bringing BLE sensors online from a host computer.

The BLE gateway is the embedded bridge between supported sensors and the RS Nexus host stack. In production deployments it integrates into **Nexus N3 Edge**, the primary edge product in ``rs-nexus-os``.

Public repository: `Nexus-N3/rs-nexus-ble-tooling <https://github.com/Nexus-N3/rs-nexus-ble-tooling>`_.

Two documentation entry points are provided so a website can link directly to either the hands-on tutorial or the broader product and API documentation:
